# minimum-number-of-coins
Given a value V, if we want to make a change for V cents, and we have an infinite supply of each of C = { C1, C2, .., Cm} valued coins, what is the minimum number of coins to make the change?
This problem is a variation of the problem discussed Coin Change Problem. Here instead of finding the total number of possible solutions, we need to find the solution with the minimum number of coins.
